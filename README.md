# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Things to do:
- Modals for crud operations on trip sub-models
- Different display based on the role of the user for that trip? (admin, traveler, owner)
- Automatically hide the trip sub-models based on the status of the trip
- Handle quick edit for the date of the trip
- improve the cards shown for the trip sub-models
- improve the trips list view
- ability to add/remove travelers from a trip
- ability to change user role for a trip
- create accounts page
- implement notifications(passport expiry, upcoming trips etc.)




Brainstorming:
- UI for tracking expenses - this should track if someone owes money to the group/individual
- UI for everyone going on the trip to vote on trip sub-models
- UI for weather for a trip and provide summary or suggestions of clothing/packing
- UI for explore/find flights page
- UI for explore/find hotels page
- UI for explore/find activities page
- UI for explore/find transport page
- UI for displaying files/emails/docs/etc. for a trip
